    "=======================\n",
    "\n",
    "Sequential logic is digital logic with *state*, i.e., memory.\n",
    "Unlike combinational circuits, where outputs depend only on the current inputs,\n",
    "in sequential circuits outputs are a function of both the current inputs and the state.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common type of sequential circuits are *single-clock synchronous\n",
    "sequential circuits*. In these circuits, state is maintained in *registers* that all share the same periodic *clock signal*.\n",
    "Registers update their contents simultaneously, at the rising edge of the clock.\n",
    "This allows discretizing time into cycles and abstracting sequential circuits as *finite state machines (FSMs)*.\n",
    "\n",
    "In lecture, we have seen how to describe the behavior of FSMs using truth tables or state-transition diagrams, and how to implement them as sequential circuits with registers (flip-flops) and logic gates.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will learn how to design sequential circuits in Minispec, which are implemented as *modules*. We will cover the following topics:\n",

    "8. [Building good module interfaces](#8_patterns)\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial is structured to get you started quickly: [Section 2](#2_introByExample) presents a sequence of simple examples that illustrate the main points of describing, composing, synthesizing, and simulating sequential circuits. The later sections expand on the finer points of each topic, presenting the syntax and semantics of modules in detail.\n",

    "Minispec *modules* implement FSMs. The figure below (left) shows the canonical representation of an FSM. On each cycle, the FSM stores a particular *state* (in registers) and takes some *inputs*. Combinational logic within the FSM uses the state and inputs to compute the *next state* of the FSM and its *outputs* for the current cycle. At the end of the cycle (i.e., in the next rising clock edge), registers update their values, placing the FSM into the next state.\n",

    "2. **Methods**, which implement combinational logic to produce outputs given some input arguments and the current state.\n",
    "3. **Rules**, which implement combinational logic to produce the next state given some external inputs and the current state.\n",

    "The figures above show two modules: a basic module with registers but no other submodules (middle figure), and a general module that includes submodules other than registers (right figure).\n",
    "Comparing the left and middle figures, we see that the key difference between modules and FSMs is the distinction between *inputs* and *method arguments*: whereas combinational logic in FSMs can use any input to produce both the next state and the output, module methods use arguments to produce outputs, separate from the inputs used by rules. As we will see later, this distinction makes modules easy to compose: whereas building an FSM by composing smaller FSMs can cause combinational cycles, a module can be composed from other submodules without combinational cycles, regardless of the implementation of the submodules.\n",

    "- *Line 2* instantiates a submodule, a 2-bit register named `count`. This submodule is a 2-bit register because its type is `Reg#(Bit#(2))`. In general, `Reg#(T)` denotes a register of values of type `T`. Also, `Reg#(T)` takes its initial value as an *argument*, `0` in this case. Arguments are specified in parentheses after the submodule name.\n",
    "- *Line 3* declares a method named `getCount` that returns the current value of the `count` register. In general, writing the name of a register (e.g., `count`) yields its current value. Also, in general methods can have arguments, though in this case `getCount` doesn't have any.\n",

Each rule *automatically executes (i.e., fires) every cycle*. The `increment` rule increments `count` if the `enable` input is `True`. To write to the `count` register, the rule uses a *register assignment operator* `<=`. Register assignments have some crucial differences from normal variable assignments (using `=`), mainly in that *the assigned value is not immediately visible*, as registers are updated at the end of the cycle. We will see all the differences in detail later.\n",

    "In this example, `FourBitCounter` consists of two `TwoBitCounter` submodules, but does not directly instantiate any register submodules (it is an example of the *general module* figure in [Section 1](#1_modulesVsFsms) above). Instead, `FourBitCounter`'s `increment` rule sets the `enable` inputs of its `lower` and `upper` submodules: it increments lower every time `enable` is true, and increments `upper` when `enable` is true and `lower` has reached its maximum value (i.e., it's about to wrap around to zero). With this logic, the concatenation of the upper and lower counts is a 4-bit counter that grows by 1 on every cycle in which `enable` is `True`.\n",

    "Finally, when modules are composed hierarchically like in this case, the execution semantics are very simple: the system behaves as if, on each cycle, **rules fire sequentially, outside-in**. Specifically, in this case, `FourBitCounter`'s `increment` rule fires, setting the inputs for its submodules. Then, the `increment` rules for the `lower` and `upper` submodules fire. Though more complex types of composition are possible, in 6.004 we will always use hierarchical composition.\n",

    "#### Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "Rules specify combinational logic that updates the state of the module, i.e., they implement side-effects.\n",
    "Specifically, rules set the values to be written in registers at the end of the cycle and the inputs of submodules. Rules use the following syntax:\n",
    "```minispec\n",
    "rule ruleName;\n",
    "    stmt1\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "    stmtN\n",
    "endrule\n",
    "```\n",
    "Rules *fire (i.e., automatically execute) every cycle*. A module may have multiple rules, but these rules cannot have overlapping side-effects (i.e., they must update disjoint registers and inputs). Any such overlap will cause a compiler error.\n",
    "\n",
    "<a id='4_registers'></a>\n",
    "## 4. Registers\n",
    "\n",
    "Registers are the most basic module. `Reg#(T)` stores a value of type `T`. `T` can be any type that can be represented as bits.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Declaration:** Modules can declare registers with the usual syntax for submodules. `Reg#(T)` takes an initial value, so its declaration is `Reg#(T) regName(initialValue);`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Initial values allow registers to start set to known values.\n",
    "This requires some additional *reset* circuitry, as we saw in the `FourBitCounter` example.\n",
    "If it’s not necessary to have an initial value, this circuitry can be avoided by using `RegU#(T)`,\n",
    "a variant of Reg#(T) that starts on an unknown value.\n",
    "`RegU#(T)` declarations do not take an initial value: `RegU#(T) regName;`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reads:** Registers can be read from anywhere in the module. Simply using the name of the register yields its value.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Writes:** Registers can be written from rules using the following syntax:\n",
    "```minispec\n",
    "regName <= expr;\n",
    "```\n",
    "where `regName` is the register’s name and `expr` is the value to be be written to it. Note how register writes are not normal assignments: they use `<=` instead of `=` and have different semantics in two key aspects:\n",
    "1. *Register writes do not take place until the end of the cycle*. Reading a register value in the same rule and after a register write statement will yield the value of the register in the current cycle, not the value set by the register write.\n",
    "2. *Registers can be written only once*. In each cycle, a register may be written at most once. A rule that writes the same register multiple times will cause a compiler error. Two rules that may write to the same register will cause a compiler error. Registers need not be written every cycle; if not written, a register retains its previous value.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example: Accumulator.** The example below shows a multi-cycle accumulator that illustrates the use of `Reg` and `RegU` and register assignment semantics. `Accumulator` takes a stream of input values, one per cycle, and stores their running sum. Together with each value, the accumulator takes a command (`cmd`), which can be either `Add` or `Set`. `Add` causes the current value to be added to the running sum, while `Set` discards the running sum and sets the accumulator to the given value.\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid the reset logic for the `runningSum` register, the accumulator uses a `RegU` to store it, plus a `Bool` register `valid` initialized to `False`. On the first cycle, `valid` transitions from `False` to `True` and `runningSum` always captures the first value given, discarding its (garbage) initial value. Finally, note how *register writes do not take place until the end of the cycle*: in cycle 0, the `tick` rule writes `valid <= True;`, but the expression `(!valid || in.cmd == Set)` in the next line *still sees valid is set to False*."

    "\n",

    "In [Section 1](#1_modulesVsFsms), we said that modules add structure over FSMs by splitting module arguments and inputs, and that this *makes hierarchical composition easy*. Specifically, the separation between rule inputs and method arguments allows modules to instantiate and use arbitrary submodules **while avoiding combinational cycles**, i.e., ensuring that combinational logic remains acyclic.\n",

Registers with an initial value (i.e., `Reg#(T)`) include reset circuitry that sets its value to the initial value when the circuit powers up. Because flip-flops hold an arbitrary value when first powered, this is accomplished by the RST signal: the RST signal is 1 for a few cycles after power-up, letting registers write their initial values with the reset circuitry shown in the figure to the right. Registers with no initial value (i.e., `RegU#(T)`) have no reset circuitry. RST_N is simply an inverted (negated) RST signal: it is 0 for a few cycles after power-up. Depending on the standard cell library, RST or RST_N will be used.\n",

    "So far, we have seen how to write sequential circuits with a given set of methods and inputs, i.e., a pre-specified interface. However, there are many ways to design a module's interface, i.e., how it interacts with the outside world. A good interface will make the module simple to implement and easy to use, whereas a bad interface can make the module brittle and introduce frequent errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Group related inputs and outputs\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will see some design strategies and introduce a new type that will keep your modules simple and make them easy to use correctly by other modules. All we will see is several manifestations of the following basic principle:\n",
    "**minimize the number of inputs and methods** by **grouping related inputs and outputs**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, any time your module may need to take several inputs together, or produce multiple related outputs that the module's user should access together, those different pieces of data should be grouped into **a single input or method**, instead of transferred using several inputs and methods. This will often require *using composite types like structs* for inputs and method outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have already seen this principle at work! In the accumulator example from [Section 4](#4_registers), the Accumulator module used a single input to convey both an input and a command:\n",
    "```minispec\n",
    "typedef enum { Add, Set } AccumulatorCmd;\n",

    "    input AccumulatorInput in default = AccumulatorInput { cmd: Add, value : 0 };\n",

    "    method Bool isValid = valid;\n",
    "    method Bit#(16) sum = runningSum;\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "This approach requires declaring a custom `AccumulatorStruct`. But the benefits are well worth it! Consider the alternative approach where we define two inputs instead:\n",
    "```minispec\n",
    "    input Cmd inCmd default = Add;\n",
    "    input Bit#(16) inValue default = 0;\n",
    "```\n",
    "This alternative approach would make `Accumulator` **harder to use**: the module user could forget to set one input, or set inputs on different cycles, or misread the defaults, introducing errors. In this case, we want to do something specific with the value we're passing, so the command and the value should be grouped together.\n",
    "\n",
    "Though `Accumulator` is using the principle of grouping related inputs and methods, it is not using it enough: it has two methods for two pieces of related information, the running sum and whether the sum is valid. This is error-prone, because the module's user could use the output from the `sum()` method without checking the output of `isValid()`, . Instead, we should have a single method that returns **both** whether the sum is valid, and, if so, its value.\n",

    "**Checking for validity:** The built-in function `isValid` returns `True` if its argument\n",
    "is `Valid`, and `False` if it is `Invalid`.\n",

The module outputs this result safely by using a Maybe type: the `result` method returns `Valid(y)` only when y has a valid result, and `Invalid` otherwise.\n",

    "\n",
    "We have seen how Minispec makes sequential circuits composable by describing them as modules. Modules can be composed hierarchically without introducing combinational cycles, and their composition yields simple semantics: the system behaves as if rules fire sequentially, outside-in.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although these semantics make modules easy to understand, it is important to remember that the system is intrinsically parallel, with potentially many computations and register assignments happening concurrently in a single cycle. As with combinational logic, you should never forget that you're describing hardware, not software.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial omits some of the finer details of the Minispec language; to dig deeper, please check the [Minispec reference] for the full semantics.\n",
